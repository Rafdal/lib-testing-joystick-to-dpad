##### Joystick as a directional pad

The objective of this simple library is to use a traditional arduino Joystick module as a four-arrow button matrix directional pad

<u>With traditional button methods like:</u>
* <b>onClick</b>( callback );
* <b>onRelease</b>( callback );
* <b>onLongPress</b>( callback );
* <b>whileLongPress</b>( callback );

For each direction of the joystick *(up, down, left and right)*
