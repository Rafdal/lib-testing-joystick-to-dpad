# Joystick2Pad
#### Joystick as a directional pad

The objective of this simple library is to use a traditional arduino Joystick module as a four-arrow button matrix directional pad

With traditional button methods like:
* <b>onClick</b>( callback );
* <b>onRelease</b>( callback );
* <b>onLongPress</b>( callback );
* <b>whileLongPress</b>( callback );

For each direction of the joystick (up, down, left and right)
